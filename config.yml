pipeline: "pipe"
# ABSOLUTE path to directory holding the working directory:
workdir_top: "Workspaces"
# Repository URL:
repo: "https://github.com/nanoporetech/pipeline-isONclust2.git"

## Pipeline-specific parameters:
cores: 20

# cDNA or direct RNA reads in fastq format
reads_fastq: "evaluation/data/SIRV_PSC109_phmm_fl.fq"

# The path above is a directory, find and concatenate fastq files:
concatenate: true

# Process cDNA reads using pychopper, turn off for direct RNA:

# Minimum number of minimizers shared between read and cluster:
min_shared: 5

# Minimum average quality value:
min_qual: 7.0

# Minmum mapped fraction of read to be included in cluster:
mapped_threshold: 0.7

# Minimum aligned fraction of read to be included in cluster:
aligned_threshold: 0.4

# Minimum fraction of minimizers shared compared to best hit, in order to continue mapping:
